<h3>Welcome to HCUnits!</h3>
<h6><b>About Us</b></h6>
<p>
  HCUnit is an open-sourced project created by Clay Wood. The code for
  the site can be found at the
  <a href="https://github.com/Oedious/hcunits/">HCUnits GitHub repository</a>.
  Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/Oedious/hcunits/tree/main/db">Unit data</a>
  can be found in JSON and XML form.

  You may notice that HCUnits has no advertisements. We intend for it to
  stay that way.
