<h3>Account Deletion</h3>
<h6><b>How do I delete my account?</b></h6>
<p>
  First, ensure that you're <a href="/accounts/login/">logged in</a> and then go to our
  <a href="/accounts/delete/">Account Deletion</a> page.
</p>
<p>
  Be careful though - once you delete your account, it will also delete any
  teams you've built - even those that you've shared with others.  Once it's
  gone, there's no option for recovery.
