<h3>Account Creation</h3>
<h6><b>Do I need to use Third-Parties for Account Creation?</b></h6>
<p>
  Yes - we require a Google or Facebook login to create an HCUnits account.
  This may seem like an unconventional choice, but the reality is that effective
  account management is a lot of hard work - password recovery, two-factor
  auth, etc.  In the end, we want to focus our energy on making a great
  HeroClix team-building site instead.

<h6><b>What info do you give to or take from Third-Parties (ie Google or Facebook)?</b></h6>
<p>
  Almost nothing - just a credential that tells us you're the same user that
  logged in last time. The username you provide to us when you finalize your
  account is stored by us to help give you credit for the Teams you share. The
  (optional) email address helps us contact you only if really necessary, such
  as in the event of account recovery.
