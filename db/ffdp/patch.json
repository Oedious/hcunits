      "description": "Orange squares are Underwater squares: they are blocking terrain and can't be destroyed. Walls bordering Underwater squares are Hull. When a character misses with a ranged combat attack that would deal damage, extend the line of fire from the attacker to each missed target until it would be blocked by a wall. If that wall is a Hull, the wall is destroyed. Whenever a Hull is destroyed for any reason, place a water terrain marker instead of a debris marker in the adjacent square that is not Underwater terrain. At the beginning of each player's turn, that player rolls a d6, subtracts 2 (minimum 0), and then places that many water terrain markers in squares adjacent to other water terrain markers placed as a result of a broken wall."
